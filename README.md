#### Where does it go?
**This is a unix system, I know this!**:<br />
a. __Google Chrome__: ~/.config/google-chrome/Default/User\ StyleSheets/Custom.css<br />
b. __Chromium__: ~/.config/chromium/Default/User\ StyleSheets/Custom.css

**People everywhere love Windows.**:
C:\Users\YourUsername\AppData\Local\Google\Chrome\User Data\Default\User StyleSheets\Custom.css

**When the apple is ripe, it will fall.**:
~/Library/Application\ Support/Google/Chrome/Default/User\ StyleSheets/Custom.css



If you are wondering what exactly the re-appearing comment "c?" is for in the SASS
file, it's simply the way I marked all the accent colors for quick travel with vim.
My plan is to adjust some of the accents in the future. The "c?" stands for "change?".
